## Introduction

TigerVNC is a open-source VNC (Virtual Network Computing) software, that allows users to use graphical applications on servers.

**Prerequisites**

Following things are required:
* a hetzner cloud server
* Ubuntu 18.04 (tested)


## Step 1 - Installing packages

The easiest way of installing TigerVNC on a new system is by using the `apt` repository.
```bash
apt update
apt upgrade
# Install virtual window manager, terminal emulator, xfce and tigervnc
apt install fvwm xterm xfce4 xfce4-goodies gnome-session tigervnc-standalone-server tigervnc-common
```


## Step 2 - Configurate and start the vnc server

### Step 2.1 - Start and kill the vnc server

To start the server you can run the following command:
```bash
vncserver
```

at the first start you must enter a vnc password.

To kill vnc instances run the following commands:
```bash
# Kill all running vnc instances
vncserver -kill :*

# Kill only one instance by id
vncserver -kill :<id>

# To list all running instances you can use
vncserver -list
```

### Step 2.2 - Configurate the vnc server

You can create a configuration file at `~/.vnc/xstartup`.
```bash
# Create the startup file
touch ~/.vnc/xstartup

# Set the file permission
chmod 700 ~/.vnc/xstartup

# Edit the file
vi ~/.vnc/xstartup
```

An example configuration for xfce4:
```
#!/bin/sh
xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
startxfce4 &
```

### Step 2.3 - Complete configuration

Finish the configuration by start the server:
```bash
vncserver
```

## Step 3 - Connect to vnc
To connect from local computer to vnc server open a ssh tunnel to server:
```bash
ssh holu@10.0.0.1 -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901
```

After this you can use a vnc client to connect to server.

## Conclusion

You are now ready to access to your root server via vnc (For example by the client named `vncviewer` provided from TigerVNC).
